## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi, I’m **Victor Delamonica** — a mobile developer passionate about creating beautiful and functional applications that make a difference.
With years of experience in mobile development, I've worked on various projects that have helped me grow as a developer.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new festivals and events in different cities.
Music and food are my two favorite things, and I love trying new style of music.

I specialize in:

- 📱 **Flutter**
- 🔥 **Firebase**
- 🎨 **Figma**

This portfolio is part of the [**Monikode**](https://github.com/Mon1Kode) organization, where I maintain and showcase my professional and collaborative projects.
